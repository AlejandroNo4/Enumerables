# Enumerables

> This project shows the construction of enumerable methods from my perspective.

This project is part of the Microverse Ruby curriculum. The objective of this project was to recreate some enumerators that already are built-in Ruby.


The rebuilt enumerators are:
- #each => #my_each
- #each_with_index => #my_each_with_index
- #select => #my_select
- #all? => #my_all?
- #any? => #my_any?
- #none? => #my_none?
- #count=> #my_count
- #map> #my_map
- #inject=> #my_inject

As an additional, you can find at the Miscellaneous part, two extra versions of #my_map, that can only accept either blocks or procs.

In addition to the methods, you can find some tests within the script in the comments. You can run these tests in your terminal. In the following sections, you can read how to do it.

## Built With

- Ruby 2.7.0p0
- VsCode
- Git

## Getting Started

**Keep in mind that it is preferable to run this program with the most up-to-date version of Ruby.**
**To use enumerators in Ruby 1.8, you must use "require 'enumerator.'" In Ruby 1.9 or later versions, enumerators are built-in, and no "require" is necessary.**


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge in ruby programming.
- Visual Studio Code, ruby (preferable the latest version), and Git previously installed.
- A GitHub account.

### Setup

[- If you don't have Ruby installed, you can see how in this link.](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation)

### First things first

[- Open this link on GitHub and clone the repository.](https://github.com/AlejandroNo4/Enumerables/tree/feature-enumerables)

### Usage

- Open the "script.rb" file in Visual Studio Code and take a look at the code.

### Run tests

- Uncomment the lines of code in the "Tests" part. I recommend you uncomment one by one as you use them, to avoid confusion.
- Open the terminal in your VSCode and run the program by typing "ruby script.rb"
- You will be able to see the result in the same terminal. 
- You will notice that each function is related to the array of the variable "a."
